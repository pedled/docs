## General Info

The model of circadian phototransduction published in 2005 <b>(1)</b>, and revised in 2021 <b>(2,3)</b>, represents the “instantaneous” response by a neural circuit in the retina stimulating the SCN. Even though it took a one-hour exposure duration to experimentally determine CL<sub>A</sub> and CS (1 hour of exposure), these two metrics can now be taken from the psychological response domain to the physical stimulus domain characterizing the spectral sensitivity of a single circadian phototransduction circuit (CL<sub>A</sub>) as well as the response characteristic to different amounts of spectrally weighted optical radiation (CS) <b>(4)</b>.

## Duration of Exposure

The functional relationship between melatonin suppression and the light spectrum and amount was extended by a duration-dependent parameter (<i>t</i>) to predict circadian stimulus / nocturnal melatonin suppression during the early biological night for exposure durations ranging between 0.5 hour and 3.0 hours. Recently published data <b>(4)</b> using the duration factor suggest that ambient lighting commonly found in North American homes will not suppress melatonin for durations up to 3 hours. Self-luminous displays used in the hours leading up to sleep have been shown to affect sleep after prolonged viewing <b>(5)</b>.

## Spatial Distribution Scalar

The functional relationship between melatonin suppression and the light spectrum and amount was extended through a spatial-distribution-dependent parameter to predict nocturnal melatonin suppression during the early subjective biological night for three different types of light source spatial profiles: Ganzfeld type light box (weighting = 2.0); narrow linear on-axis fixture (weighting = 1.0); and indirect overhead lighting (weighting = 0.5).
